# rgstr

An example service that allows creating and listing some items. 

Uses `application` as an item and creating it is referred to as `registering`.

This project is an assigned task requiring the app to use
`/testapp/*` context and `testapp.jar` names.
I didn't want to name the whole app `testapp` thus polluting the namespaces,
so I tried to minimize the usage of this word.
Search for comments containing `task requirement` for details.

## Prerequisites
